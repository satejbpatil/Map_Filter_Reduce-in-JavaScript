Learn how to use Map, Filter, and Reduce to make any data super clean and easy to work with. âœ¨ It's like magic! ðŸª„

**Map, filter and reduce are higher order functions in javascript.**

## **1. map()**

The map() function is used to transformation of an array.

Array transformations involve manipulating the elements of an array to create a new array with modified or processed values.

## **2. filter()**

The filter() function in JavaScript is used to create a new array containing only elements that satisfy a specified condition. 

It is a higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument, and this callback function defines the condition for filtering.

## **3. Reduce()**

The reduce() function in JavaScript is used to reduce the array to a single value and executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left to right) and the return value of the function is stored in an accumulator. 

**acc (Accumulator):** It is the accumulated result of the callback's return values. It starts with an initial value and gets updated in each iteration based on the return value of the callback. The accumulator holds the cumulative result as the function processes each element in the array.

**curr (Current Value):** It represents the current element being processed in the array during each iteration. In other words, it is the value of the current element that the callback function is currently operating on.
